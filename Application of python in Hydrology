Q-1:-
# Calculation of total Infiltration by Horton's Equation
fo = float(input("Enter the value of initial Infiltration Rate:"))
fc= float(input("Enter the value of Final infiltration Rate:"))
t = int(input("Enter the value of Time:"))
kh= float(input("Enter the value of Decay Coefficient:"))
 # The total Infiltration is given by: 
Fp= fc't+ (fo - fc)/kh
print ("The value of Total Infiltration is:", Fp)


Output:-
Enter the value of initial Infiltration Rate:6
Enter the value of Final infiltration Rate:1.2
 Enter the value of Decay Coefficient: 0.888
Enter the value of Time: 8
The value of Total Infiltration is: 15.005405405405405
